Hi This code is regarding Designing Magical Arena, Where every player has the following attributes - name, health, attack, strength. 2 Player will fight this game and attack based on a rolling dice. This program will end when one of the players dies.

To run this application we need **Java 17, maven and JUnit**.

Clone the project or download the zip file to access the project and allow maven to load the dependencies.

After that simply run the **GameApplication.java** file to start the game.

Game will ask you name, health, strenth and attack for each player and will start the game.

It will give you output in logs for each turn and the final result on who wins the game.

To run test cases simply run Files in Test package namely **CombatServiceTest.java** and **PlayerTest.java**
